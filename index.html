          <h1>OBJECTIVES OF THE PROJECT</h1>
          <p>
            The company problem appears when it is intended to equip its
            building with an elevator and want to know according to its needs
            the way to settle the elevator to best satisfy this needs. Where
            this company my need from 1 to 4 elevators and the building will be
            of 100 floors (not including ground floor). The way where an
            Object-Oriented Software Simulator is to be installed, concerning
            the logic required to move the elevator between floors, giving the
            company a clear idea and leading it to choose the best design which
            satisfy this needs. An elevator (or lift) is a vertical transport
            vehicle that efficiently moves people or goods between floors of a
            building. They are generally powered by electric motors that either
            drive traction cables and counterweight systems, or pump hydraulic
            fluid to raise a cylindrical piston.

          <h2>REQUIREMENT SPECIFICATION</h2>
          <p>
            a) The first and the foremost important hardware required is a
            laptop of a personal computer with a minimum of 4GB RAM.<br />b) We
            require an IDE where we can type our code and where it can be
            compiled and executed successfully. <br />c) Next is the right
            knowledge of Object Oriented Programming. Under it we are required
            to study concepts such has classes and objects, function
            overloading, constructors and destructors, inheritance concepts and
            types of inheritance concept, data abstraction , data encapsulation,
            visibility modes and their importance, friend functions and their
            rules of application, static variables and functions, function
            overriding, early binding, late binding, virtual functions concept
            and pure virtual functions.
          </p>
          <h2>PROBLEM FEATURES</h2>
          <p>
            The problem concerns the logic required to move elevators between
            floors according to the following constraints:<br />
            a) Having a unique control system, which control the elevators and
            pick up the requests. <br />b) Each elevator has a set of m buttons,
            one for each floor. These illuminate when pressed and cause the
            elevator to visit the corresponding floor. The illumination is
            canceled when the elevator visits the corresponding floor.<br />
            c) Each floor, except the first floor and top floor has two buttons,
            one to request an up elevator and one to request a down-elevator.
            These buttons illuminate when pressed. The illumination is canceled
            when an elevator visits the floor and then moves in the desired
            direction.<br />
            d) Continue traveling in the same direction while there are
            remaining requests in that same direction. <br />e) When an elevator
            has no requests, it remains at its current floor with its doors
            closed.<br />
            The elevator algorithm is implemented in computer operating systems
            as an algorithm for scheduling hard disk requests.
          </p>
          <h2>SNAPSHOTS</h2>

          <p>1) File where all the requests are stored</p>
          <a href="#!"> <img src="C1.JPG" alt="Project" /> </a>
          <p>2) After processing the first request from the file</p>
          <a href="#!"> <img src="C2.JPG" alt="Project" /> </a>
          <p>3) Condition when no. of passengers exceeds the limit 8</p>
          <a href="#!"> <img src="C3.JPG" alt="Project" /> </a>
          <p>4) Processing another lift request from the file</p>
          <a href="#!"> <img src="C4.JPG" alt="Project" /> </a>
          <h3>FUTURE WORK PERSPECTIVES</h3>
          <p>
            Some of the future work that could be implemented:<br />
            a) Speed control may be available to the user of the simulator to
            see different simulations with different speeds.<br />
            b) The elevator needs the ability to change directions if the user
            decides to go down instead of up (and vice versa) when there are no
            other requests for that elevator.<br />
            c) Elevator will be supplied by inventor, in the case of electricity
            failure elevator will go down to the nearest floor and open its
            doors.<br />
            d) An emergency alarm switch will sound an alarm when activated by a
            passenger.<br />
            e) Elevator will be supplied by Priority system, which is used by
            specific users like managers, where they can press certain code
            making the elevator moving straight forward to the wanted floor
            without stopping in any floor.
